            <p>My biggest challenge was copy and pasting boiler plate HTML code.</p>
            <p>I did not learn anything during this assignment. I am already familiar with HTML + CSS.</p>
            <p>The most useful resource for this assignment was Google because I had to use it to search up boiler plate HTML code.</p>

            <p>My biggest challenge was following the mockups down to the pixel. To make sure it was accurate, I pulled out my ruler to measure divs.</p>
            <p>I learned how much I love Tailwind and how much I do not like frontend development. It is so finicky for no reason >:(.</p>
            <p>The most useful resource for this assignment was Google because I had to search up a couple CSS rules.</p>
            <p>One thing I had to google was how to add a drop shadow and animation.</p>
